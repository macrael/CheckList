Lots working!

* when you add a new item while already editing, scroll into the right place if
  needed.

* get on a phone
* have the default list item name be nothing

* figure out the right way to name lists when creating them
    * could edit in title bar?
        * really looks good, but need good ui
            * I think we want a popover that says "Set Title" or something
        * con: weird act from front page
            * would just slide over
    x could edit inline as we do lists.
        * Can't edit while editing the rest of the list.
        * This is consistent, edit both list items the same way.
    * double tap to edit?
        * Definitely need to be able to edit the title. 

* better checkbox
* do I need a checkbox animation?
    * Things does, hace a nice one. 

* Stop zeroing out data on launch.

* icon

* only check checkbox when you click on it? Not whole item?
    * (maybe keep it this way? Is kind of good.)
    * if we revert this, we will have to deal with selection

* shake to clear everything, with confirmation.

BUGS:
* create items, delete a couple, create a new one: item has title, checked state
* if editing mode is scrolled off the end, we end up with nothing. 
    * This was kind of expected. 
    * Need to create on call again.
* doing the above and then hit return, replaced the first one. WEIRD
* at some point I got stuck with an empty cell at the bottom, this prevented
  further editing
* Actual problem is that if you create an item off screen, you get blank
* Text jumps on either 4 or < 
    * 9.6 vs 10. 
* We aren't reloading the data, so the list view is always wrong.
* The title of lists does not have the correct outline that list titles are
  supposed to have


EDITING
* Modeless would be great
* This might be some real reworking
* re-ordering
    * could be enabled all the time
* edit all the things
    * If this is really challenging, can just skip. You can always just
      recreate.
* how do I enable besides when clicking plus?
* double (tripple?) or long tap to enter editing mode? 
    * at least to edit inline. 
    * This actually kind of works: you want to change something (position,
      title) so you double click on it to do so
* How do I get out of editing mode? 
    * replace + button?
    * replace back button?
* batch deletion
    * Who cares. 
* could edit the title by double tapping
    * If we do that, we need to do it everywhere. 
        * if we can edit list items, the done button should dismiss the
          keyboard

* Should the list have proper textfields in all of them instead of labels that
  we replace. 


Front Ordering
* order by last access date
* if that access date is in the past, switch all checks to no
* NO. "recently accessed" section, and old section, alphabetical.
* Do I need a separator? Or just have an icon that shows how many are complete,
  all newly edited ones will end up at the top naturally. 

* maybe uncheck everything once you check everything?
    * I think this is a bad plan. Let it time out and let it be clearable.

* Display percentage checked on frontpage

x gray out the selected item
    * Should work when editing

* should you be able to toggle the checkbox on an editing item?
    * why not?


----

* search for list by name

* sounds?
* many different loooking check boxes? (hand drawn)

* The plus button doesn't need to fade betweeen list views.
